# TestingGroundsGame
An FPS game done with Unreal Engine during studying [this great course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/).

This project uses Git LFS to store heavy assets, so to get all project files you should install git lfs (see [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation))
and pull them (``` git lfs pull ```)
